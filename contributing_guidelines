When making a new file, do NOT put spaces in the file name! 
Either_use_underscores OR use-dashes. It's good practice!

When you commit, using the default message is fine. If you want to be super cool, add your own custom message!
Make sure that it starts with an actionable verb so we know what you did. And make sure it has the file's name or the 
certain feature's name so we know what exactly has been changed.

If you're adding images, put them in the images folder!

If you're adding text files, put them in the txtfiles folder!

If you're going to change someone else's text file, it's polite to create a pull request instead of directly committing. 
Let the person decide if you can add the thing or not!
